# Problem Statement: Traffic Sign Recognition #

![alt text](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*HBllwUCObQcZ1OfuuHwVfA.jpeg)

**Are you excited about the autonomous/ self-driving cars?
If yes, this project if made for you!! All these cars will require a system to identify the traffic signs on roadsides in real-time. 
Here is an opportunity for you to build one for yourself.**

**Dataset options:**

1. [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset) 

    * Overview:
    * Single-image, multi-class classification problem
    * More than 40 classes
    * More than 50,000 images in total
    * Large, lifelike database
    * Reliable ground-truth data due to semi-automatic annotation


2. [Belgian Traffic Sign Dataset](https://btsd.ethz.ch/shareddata/)
    * There are a lot of datasets on that page, but you only need the two files listed under BelgiumTS for Classification (cropped images):
    * BelgiumTSC_Training (171.3MBytes)
    * BelgiumTSC_Testing (76.5MBytes)

* You can build a shallow Convolution Neural Network to solve this problem
* I would suggest to firstly try it out yourself, if you can’t then follow the links given herewith:

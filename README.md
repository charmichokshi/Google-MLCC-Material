# Google-s-MLCC-Material
This repository contains presentations and codes developed by me while delivering Google's Machine Learning Crash Couse in 2017 and 2018.

[Ideathon Pedagogy](): A standard Pedagogy one can follow while arranging any Ideathon on Machine Learning. I have also put a few slides on the basics of ML and its use cases along with speakers note which will ease the understanding of other facilitators while referring to this presentation and using them in the future.
